## Question

VAS Cinemas has 3 different cinemas across Lagos, each cinemas has 
their respective showtimes for each movies available, using Laravel,
build a minimalistic application showing the list of movies with 
different showtimes in each cinemas and provision for adding them from 
a user authenticated page. Let your code reflect the following:

- Use of repository pattern as an additional layer between the model 
and the controller

- Use the Eloquent ORM relationships for the entities

- Represent each of the entities (i.e. users, showtimes, cinemas, 
movies) as its own Laravel module (Optional but recommended)


# hosted project
- [VAS Cinemas](http://vascinema.herokuapp.com/).


**Represent each of the entities (i.e. users, showtimes, cinemas, 
movies) as its own Laravel module (Optional but recommended) using [Laravel Modules](https://github.com/nWidart/laravel-modules)

I tried to use this package but I was always getting an error after I create the first module (I wasnt able to use the artisan command after the first module creation). so as not to waste time, I decided to go through the normal method of using laravel (I tried looking for solutions to the problem though)
